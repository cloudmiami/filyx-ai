## 🎨 **ChatGPT Prompt - Copy & Paste This:**

```
Create a full-bleed 1024x1024 px app icon: Three rounded rectangles representing document categories overlapping with soft gradients, following the proven "overlapping shapes" pattern using professional blue (#3B6AC7), business green (#3EA65C), and professional amber (#E69B28) gradients. Use crisp, minimal design with vibrant colors. Add a subtle inner bevel for gentle depth; no hard shadows or outlines. Center the design with comfortable breathing room from the edges. Solid, light-neutral background. IMPORTANT: Fill the entire canvas edge-to-edge with the design, no padding, no margins. Design elements should be centered with appropriate spacing from edges but the background must cover 100% of the canvas. Clean, minimal, Apple-style design. No borders, frames, or rounded corners.
